Description
------------
Since webtrees 2.0 you have the possibility to add multiple media files to one media object. It is now possible to put multiple pages from a book into one media object or to scan the front and back of a registration card into one object or to keep multiple photos of a person together in one media object. The possibilities are endless and will help you organize your media.

This sounds great, doesn't it? In webtrees 2.0.x, all items from a single media object were displayed side by side on the facts and events tab on the individual page. Maybe you added additional notes to the media object. These notes were also displayed.

Starting with webtrees 2.1. the designer made the decision to no longer show additional media information on the facts and events tab. Only the first image is shown. Additional images belonging to the same media objects are ignored. They are also ignored in the scrolling photobox. Any additional notes are also not visible.

In my opinion, this is not a desirable situation. With this module you will get back the old behavior of webtrees 2.0.

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Unpack the zip file and place the jc-media-display folder in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default and will work immediately. No additional configuration is required.

Bugs & feature requests
-------------------------
This is a simple module and provided as is. However, if you experience any bugs you can [create a new issue on GitHub][3]. Since this is a simple module, I will be reluctant to accept feature requests.
